<h2>Solar Powered MPPT Emergency LED Lighting</h2>

<p>
This code was written for a PIC18F45K20 microcontroller in C using the CCS compiler and libraries. The code optimizes the charge rate of a pack of NiMH batteries and performs charge monitoring to prevent overcharging while seeking the maximum power point of the solar panel. It also controls an LED light test load. The code was mainly written to test the Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithm in field conditions.
